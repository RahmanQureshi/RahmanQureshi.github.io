Thank you for visiting my website! A lot of people call me Ray. I love travelling, hiking, camping and meeting new people, and I am into fitness and amateur boxing. At the same time, I spend a lot of time reading books and I nearly always have a kindle with me. I speak English and Urdu, and I spent a year in Japan so I can also speak rudimentary Japanese.
