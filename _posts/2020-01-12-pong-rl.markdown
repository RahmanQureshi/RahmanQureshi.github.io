This post is to write about my experience replicating an influential reinforcement learning paper published in 2015: [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf). I self-studied [CSC421 Deep Learning](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/) which had a publically available syllabus and whose lectures were based on accessible research papers, and after completing all the [homework](https://github.com/RahmanQureshi/csc421), I wanted to do a "capstone." 

First, I will briefly introduce reinforcement learning, and then I will discuss my experience replicating the paper.

# What is Reinforcement Learning?

In reinforcement learning, an **agent** interacts with an **environment** by observing its **state** taking some **action**. The result of the agent's action is that it may obtain some **reward** from the environment and the state of the environment changes. The agent continuously observes the new state and making actions with the goal of maximizing its total reward. This problem formulation can be used to model a myriad of situations. For instance, it can be used to model the classic Atari game pacman. The agent, pacman, has 5 actions: stay still, go up, go down, go left, and go right. The environment is the board, and it is very complex; it has obstacles, ghosts which chase pacman, pellets which cause ghosts to flee and allow pacman to eat them, and points scattered all over the board that pacman must collect.

The strategy or decision-making process that the agent uses to select it's action is called a **policy**. **Reinforcement learning** is teaching a software agent the optimal policy that maximizes its reward.

# Reinforcement Learning Theory

There are many online resources for reinforcement learning. You can find many blogs covering the basics in an intuitive way, written in an almost narrative format. Then, there are [free textbooks](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) that cover the fundamentals and advanced topics. This section is my best attempt at the former, but sprinkled with rigor insofar as it's useful to understand the paper.
