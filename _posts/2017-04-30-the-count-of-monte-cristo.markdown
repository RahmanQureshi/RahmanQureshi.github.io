The Count of Monte Cristo is a book with a compelling narrative. I enjoyed the mystery surrounding the Count's intentions as the book played out, and the surprise and gratification of a secret, intricate and careful design coming together at the end. I think the book romantices revenge to a certain extent though, and I also disagreed with the unfair (mild) vilification and treatment of Mercedes. The ending of the book was also perplexing for me, when the Count declares "all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope.'" Because didn't he spend the last several years doing almost exactly the opposite? That is to say, he designed an intricate plot and set out in its execution. Overall though, my favorite character was the Abe Farria, and out of all Edmond's interactions with him, here is part of one dialogue that most stood out to me.

Edmond Dantes had laboriously dug a hole but to his despair it lead to a pathway that was patrolled by a guard. Edmond was distraught because years of effort had been wasted. He related what he found to the Abbe Faria and proposed that he would assault the guard, kill him and then they would escape.

> ‘Since my imprisonment’, said Faria, ‘I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record… Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon, and carefully arranged… Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the best for all. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable moment, and when it presents itself, profit by it.’

Eagnerss and impatience leads to ruin. The best results are the product of careful planning and waiting for opportunity.  The Abbe Faria had the wisdom of patience and control to exercise it, and did not allow a sunken cost to undermine his decision-making. I think the reason it stuck out is because I definitely have a tendency to act too soon based on emotion.
