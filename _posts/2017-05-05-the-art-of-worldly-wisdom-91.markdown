"Never act unless you think it is prudent to do so." I had my doubts about this book based on the author and his biography and the first few rules. I expected pompousness and vagueness, but The Art of Worldly Wisdom proved to contain some actionable advice and insights.

> If the person doing something suspects he will fail, it will be evident to the person watching…if your judgement wavers in the heat of emotion, you’ll be thought a fool when things cool down. It is dangerous to undertake something when you doubt its wisdom. It would be safer not to act all all.

Obviously don’t pretend to be able to do something or have knowledge of a topic but I think this rule goes deeper than that. Sometimes it’s better not to act.

I try not to give unsolicited advice, but perhaps it is better to not even give solicited advice, or, at the very least, add lots of qualifiers. In some ways, you should ere on the side of doubting your own "wisdom," because your information on things you think you are knowledgable comes from the narrow perspective of only your own life. You don't want to be responsible for someone else's decisions. Use your wisdom to guide your own decisions, but understand your limitations and only advise others if you are certain.

Here is a tangile example of when doing nothing would have been better. When someone asked me a question, if I had minimal knowledge about the subject, I would try my best to help, but this often lead to wasting the other person’s time and looking foolish myself. I should’ve just said, “I don’t know (optionally: I’ll try to figure it out and get back to you),” then independently attempt to fully understand and solve the question, and get back to the person by asking, “did you figure it out?”

I think also that there is something to be said about having or at least feigning confidence in everything you do. I don’t think you should mislead others by feigning confidence but at least learn how to project it. There are lots of situations in life wherein we do them despite a high probability of failure, but a requirement of success is looking like you will succeed. By extension, be on the look out for others feigning confidence, because just because you will not mislead people doesn’t mean others won’t attempt to mislead you.
